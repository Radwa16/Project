            <h4>As if scenes across the Maldives weren’t stunning enough – sand, sun and blue seas – can you believe some look better after dark?

            That’s right! In certain spots in the Maldives, waters actually glow at night. Imagine tiny dots of blue glowing like scattered glitter across the rippling water. The magical sight is caused by the presence of tiny shrimp-like creatures that light up to warn off predators. Call them ‘fireflies of the sea’!

                Finding them can be a game of hide and seek, but I know you are an adventurous lot up for the challenge. This bioluminescence, as it’s called, can occur in many of the atolls, but many sightings have been around the eastern cluster that is Rangali, Vaadhoo and Mudhdhoo. Ready to glow?</h4>

        <div class="about"><em>The Maldives officially the Republic of Maldives, is a South Asian island country, located in the Indian Ocean, situated in the Arabian Sea. It lies southwest of Sri Lanka and India. The chain of 26 atolls stretches from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to the Addu City in the south. Comprising a territory spanning roughly 298 square kilometres (115 sq mi), the Maldives is one of the world's most geographically dispersed countries, as well as the smallest Asian country by both land area and population, with around 427,756 inhabitants. Malé is the capital and most populated city, traditionally called the "King's Island" for its central location.
            
            The Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s. Only 185 islands are home to its 300,000 inhabitants. The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes, of which tourism and agriculture are the most dominant. Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.</em>

Wander through Sultan Park, a reference to the time the Maldives was governed by a sultanate with an optional visit to the National Museum.

                 <!--Walking back towards the harbour area, pass by the Grand Friday Mosque and the Islamic Centre, Male's famous architectural landmark and onto Jumhooree Maiden - Independence Square. From here, learn the meaning of the Maldives national flag and pick out key government buildings.

                 Heading west along the harbour, visit the bustling fish market and the local market, where the sights, sounds and smells will fill your senses. Chat with the local stall holders and taste tropical produce and homemade sweets.

                 The tour finishes at the top of one of the city's tallest buildings, providing a great back drop to your final tour photo image! --></h5>
